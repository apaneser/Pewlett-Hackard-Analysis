# Summary

There would need to be a total of 90, 398 Roles to be filled after the "silver tsunami"
According to the data, there would be enough minimum ratio of 1:80 employees eligible for the mentorship program to new availble spots for every title except thwe manager title. There are no employees eligible for the mentorship program for the Manager Title.
There is not enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in all the departments for the next-generation of Pelwett-Hackard employees due to the lack of managers. There is also a 1:83 ratio in Staff for the Staff department, while the rest are hovering around 1:60, so each staff mentor has to handle more new employees compared to the rest of the departments.
